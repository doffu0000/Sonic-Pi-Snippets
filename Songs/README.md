Most of these songs have been saved for my personal record and contain samples from libraries saved on my computer. They may also contain sound_out_stereo routing, as I often route the audio out of Sonic Pi and into my DAW for recording and mixing.  

However, there is a lot of useful concepts and code here. You could also try swapping in your own sample library 
paths for unexpected results.
